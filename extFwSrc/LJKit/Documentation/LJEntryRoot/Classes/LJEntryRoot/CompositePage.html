<h2>Discussion</h2>
LJEntryRoot is an abstract class which represents a LiveJournal entry.  It
primarily exists to share common code between LJEntry and LJEntrySummary.
LJEntryRoot handles all journal entry meta-data; the subject and the content
fields are handled by its two subclasses.
 <hr><br><h2>Methods</h2>

<h3><a name="accessAllowedForGroup:">accessAllowedForGroup:</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Determine whether access is allowed for a specific group.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (BOOL)<B>accessAllowedForGroup:</B>(LJGroup *)<I>group;</I> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Returns YES if the members of the given group are allowed to read the
receiver, NO otherwise.  This method returns a correct response regardless
of the receiver's security mode.
<br><br>
You cannot use this and other group security related methods on unassociated
entries.  If you try, an exception will be raised.  This is because groups
have no meaning outside of their account, and unassociated entries are not
attached to an account.
 </p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="date">date</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Obtain the date of the receiver.
 
<blockquote><pre><tt>- (NSDate *)<B>date;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p></p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="groupsAllowdAccessMask">groupsAllowdAccessMask</a></h3>
<blockquote><pre><tt>- (unsigned int)<B>groupsAllowedAccessMask;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Returns the bitmask which defines the groups allowed to access the receiver.
If the security mode is not LJGroupSecurityMode, this value will make no
sense.
 </p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="groupsAllowedAccessArray">groupsAllowedAccessArray</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Determine what groups are allowed access to the receiver.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (NSArray *)<B>groupsAllowedAccessArray;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>You cannot use this and other group security related methods on unassociated
entries.  If you try, an exception will be raised.  This is because groups
have no meaning outside of their account, and unassociated entries are not
attached to an account.
</p>
<b>Result:</b> An NSArray of LJGroup objects.
 
<hr>

<h3><a name="groupsAllowedAccessSet">groupsAllowedAccessSet</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Determine what groups are allowed access to the receiver.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (NSSet *)<B>groupsAllowedAccessSet;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>You cannot use this and other group security related methods on unassociated
entries.  If you try, an exception will be raised.  This is because groups
have no meaning outside of their account, and unassociated entries are not
attached to an account.
</p>
<b>Result:</b> An NSSet of LJGroup objects.
 
<hr>

<h3><a name="initWithContentsOfFile:">initWithContentsOfFile:</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Initializes an entry object from a file.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (id)<B>initWithContentsOfFile:</B>(NSString *)<I>path;</I> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Loads an entry from an archived file.  This method uses NSKeyedUnarchiver
to read the archive from disk.
 </p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<blockquote>
<table border="1"  width="90%">
<thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>The</tt></td><td>file to read from.</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<hr>

<h3><a name="itemID">itemID</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Obtain the itemID of the receiver.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (int)<B>itemID;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>If the entry is posted, returns its itemID as reported by the server.
If the entry is only associated or unassociated, returns 0.
 </p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="journal">journal</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Obtain the journal associated with the receiver.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (LJJournal *)<B>journal;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Returns the journal that the receiver is associated with, or nil if it is
unassociated.
 </p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="postCommentsHttpURL">postCommentsHttpURL</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Returns the URL of the receiver's post comments view.
 
<blockquote><pre><tt>- (NSURL *)<B>postCommentHttpURL;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p></p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="posterUsername">posterUsername</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Obtain the username of the entry's poster.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (NSString *)<B>posterUsername;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Returns the username of the user that posted this entry, according to the
LiveJournal server.  You should assume that the receiver was posted by the
currently logged in user if this method returns nil.
 </p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="readCommentsHttpURL">readCommentsHttpURL</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Returns the URL of the receiver's read comments view.
 
<blockquote><pre><tt>- (NSURL *)<B>readCommentsHttpURL;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p></p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="removeFromJournal">removeFromJournal</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Removes the receiver from the server.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (void)<B>removeFromJournal;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>If the receiver is a posted entry, sends an editevent message to the server
so that the entry is deleted.  The receiver becomes associated with the same
journal but no longer posted.  If this method is called on an associated or
unassociated entry an exception is raised.
This method marks the receiver as edited.
 </p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="securityMode">securityMode</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Obtain the security mode of the receiver.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (int)<B>securityMode;</B> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The security modes are explained in the LJEntry Security Modes enumeration.
 </p>
<hr>

<h3><a name="writeToFile:">writeToFile:</a></h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> Writes an entry to disk.

<blockquote><pre><tt>- (BOOL)<B>writeToFile:</B>(NSString *)<I>path;</I> </tt><br>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Saves an entry to disk.  Uses NSKeyedArchiver to archive the object.
</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<blockquote>
<table border="1"  width="90%">
<thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td align="center"><tt>path</tt></td><td>The file to write to.</td></tr>
</table>
