<b>Abstract: </b>Represents an account on a LiveJournal server.
<br><br>
<hr><br>
An LJAccount object represents a user's account on a LiveJournal server.
This is the primary class used to communicate over the network with the
server.
<br><br>
LJAccount implements the NSCoding protocol, meaning account objects may
be archived to disk and loaded at a later time.  This functionality can
be used by clients to provide offline capabilities.  Properties which are
preserved during archiving are indicated in the documentation for their
accessor methods.  The an account's customInfo dictionary can be used
to store client specific information with the account.
