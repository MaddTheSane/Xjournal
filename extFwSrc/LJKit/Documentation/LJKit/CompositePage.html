<br><br>
LJKit is a Mac OS X framework written in Objective-C which encapsulates the
workings of the LiveJournal Client-Server Protocol.  It is designed to handle
most of the gruntwork involved in writing a LiveJournal client.
<br><br>
Your feedback is essential the continued development of LJKit.  If you have any
questions or comments, please don't hesitate to send email to me at
benzado&#64;livejournal.com.
<br><br>
LJKit is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
A full copy of the license is available as the file License.txt in the
Resources subdirectory of the LJKit bundle.  In short, you may use LJKit to
write a client application, and you are free to license your client as you
choose.  However, any changes you make to LJKit must be distributed under the
same terms it was licensed to you.
<br><br>
Methods and functions without HeaderDoc comments are not intended for use by
client applications.  Don't use them in your client, unless you want it to
break when LJKit is updated.  All interfaces are subject to change until LJKit
reaches version 1.0.
<br><br>
To use LJKit in a client application, you must
<ol>
<li> <b>Build LJKit.framework.</b>
I recommend you configure Project Builder to put build products in a separate
location from your project files.  This is not required, but since your
compiler output will be separate from your source code it is easier to make
backups and keep your disk tidy.
<li> <b>Add LJKit.framework to your project.</b>
You can either drag and drop the bundle from the Finder, or select
<b>Add Frameworks...</b> from Project Builder's Project menu.
<li> <b>Add a Copy Files phase to your target.</b>
Edit your target, select Build Phases, then select Project -> New Build Phase ->
New Copy Files Build Phase from the menu bar.  In the resulting panel, select
Frameworks from the Where pop up menu and drag LJKit.framework from your
project's Files tab to the Files to copy area.  This will place a copy of LJKit
inside your application's bundle.  This is the recommended way to include it,
since otherwise you must complicate your application's installation process by
requiring users to copy the framework to another location on their hard disk.
</ol>
<br><br>
If you think you have found a bug, email all relevant information to
benzado&#64;livejournal.com.  If you are trying to trace an exception, you can
catch exceptions in Project Builder's debugger by setting a symbolic breakpoint
on "-[NSException raise]".  To do so, open the Breakpoints tab, click the New
button, and type the expression in quotes above.  Be sure NOT to put a space
between the dash and the opening square bracket.

Happy hacking!
