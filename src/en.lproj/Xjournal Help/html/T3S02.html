        <p>
            If you would like to format the <b>Music</b> field, you can
            configure Xjournal's preferences to do it automatically. First,
            select the <i>Preferences</i> option from the <i>Xjournal</i>
            application menu. Click the <b>Music</b> toolbar icon to view
            Xjournal's music preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The music preferences are divided into three main sections. The
            first section allows you to specify Prefixes and Suffixes for the
            data retrieved from iTunes. The second section allows you to specify
            what fields are displayed, what order they are displayed, and what
            is used to separate them. Finally, the third section shows an
            example of what your settings will produce.
        </p>

            <b>TIP:</b> You can use HTML in these fields to create more
            customised music listings.
