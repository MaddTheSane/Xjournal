            Xjournal's History browser allows you to easily view and modify
            your journal entries. To open the browser, select the <i>History</i>
            option from the <i>Window</i> menu. It is recommended that you use
            the <b>Refresh</b> button to refresh your History view. By using the
            <b>Download</b> button, Xjournal will store your entries locally for
            faster use.

            To work with a past entry, select it using the year, month, day,
            and subject selectors. You can also search for a previous entry 
            using the <b>Search</b> field. Once selected, simply click the
            <b>Edit</b> or <b>Delete</b> buttons as appropriate. You can also
            view the entry live by clicking the <b>Open in Browser</b> button.
