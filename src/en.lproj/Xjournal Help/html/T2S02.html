            </h3>

        <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> To insert an image into your journal entry, you must
            already have the image available on a webserver.
        </p>
        <p>
            To insert the image, place your cursor at the point in your entry
            where you would like the image to appear. Next, select the
            <i>Insert Image</i> option from the <i>HTML</i> menu. In the
            <b>Image URL</b> field, enter the full URL of your image. Click the
            <i>Insert</i> button and the necessary HTML code will be inserted
            into your journal entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other fields on the image sheet are for additional parameters
            of the image. The <b>Alt Text</b> field is used to supply a piece of
            text which will be displayed to users who are viewing the entry
            with a browser which does not render images. The <b>Size</b> field
            allows you to specify the dimensions with which you want the image
            to be displayed. The <b>Space</b> field allows you to specify an
            amount of empty space to appear around the image. The <b>Border</b>
            field allows you to specify the images border size. The <b>Align</b>
            field allows you to select an alignment for the image in your entry.
