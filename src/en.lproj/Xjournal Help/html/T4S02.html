            Xjournal's Friends window has several tools for working with
            other applications. By dragging a person's Address Book entry
            and dropping it in a user's Address Card well, you can associate
            an Address Book entry with a person's LiveJournal account. You
            can also populate a new Address Book entry by selecting the desired
            user in the Friends window and then clicking the <b>Add Address</b>
            button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a user has been associated with an Address Book entry, you can
            use the <b>Chat</b> button to initiate a new iChat conversation with
            the user. You can also add a LiveJournal user's birthday to iCal by
            selecting the user and then clicking the <b>Add Birthday to iCal</b>
            button.
