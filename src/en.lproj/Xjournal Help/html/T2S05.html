            <h3>
                Using the LJ Cut tag
            </h3>
        </font>
        <p>
            LiveJournal features a special tag known as the LJ Cut tag. This tag
            allows you to "snip" portions of your journal entries to keep them
            from taking up too much space on your journal page (or other users'
            friends pages). Xjournal features support for this tag as well.

            There are two ways to use the LJ Cut tag:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first is to select the text you want to hide and then select
                the <i>LJ Cut</i> option from the <i>HTML</i> menu. Enter your
                desired text in the <B>Cut Label</b> field and click the
                <i>OK</i> button.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                The second method is to place your cursor where you would like
                the cut text to appear. Next, select the <i>LJ Cut</i> option
                from the <i>HTML</i> menu. Enter your desired text in the <b>
                Cut Label</b> field and then enter your desired text in the
                <b>Hidden Text</b> field. Finally, click the <i>OK</i> button.
            </li><br>
        </ul>
