                Adding and Removing Friends and Groups
            </h3>
        </font>
        <p>
            To work with your friends and communities, open the Friends
            window by selecting <i>Friends</i> from the <i>Window</i> menu.
            Along the left-hand side you will see the group pane, which
            is similar to iTunes' Library. On the right, upper side, you
            will find the member pane, which lists users and communities
            who are members of the container selected in the group pane.
            Finally, beneath the member pane you will find several panes
            for viewing a user's settings, recent entries, and LiveJournal
            user information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adding a new user is as easy as selecting <i>Add Friend</i> from
            the <i>Friends</i> menu. Enter the friend's LiveJournal username
            and then click OK. To delete a user from your friends list, select
            <i>All Friends</i> in the group pane. Next, select the desired user
            in the member pane. Once you've selected <i>Delete Friend</i> from
            the <i>Friends</i> menu, the user will be removed from your
            LiveJournal friends list and all groups.
        </p>
        <p>    
            To add a new group, select <i>Add Group</i> from the <i>Friends</i>
            menu. Adding one of your friends to your new group is as simple as
            dragging him from the members list and dropping him in the desired
            group. Removing a friend from a group is much the same. Select the
            group from the group pane and the friend in the member pane. Then,
            select <i>Remove Friend from Group</i> from the <i>Friends</i> menu.
            To delete a group, select it in the group pane and then select the
            <i>Delete Group</i> from the <i>Friends</i> menu.

            Once you are done making changes, be sure to click the <b>Save</b>
            button to save your changes and upload them to the LiveJournal
            servers.
