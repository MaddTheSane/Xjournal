        <p>
            Xjournal supports several different types of text formatting. These
            include italics, bold, underline, and blockquote. To use one of the
            text markups, first select the text you would like to modify. Next,
            select the desired format from the <i>HTML</i> menu. For example, if
            you wanted to make your whole entry in italics, you would use your
            cursor to select the whole entry. You would then select the
            <i>Italic</i> option from the <i>HTML</i> menu.
