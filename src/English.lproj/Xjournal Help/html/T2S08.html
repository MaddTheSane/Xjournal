                Using the Glossary
            </h3>

        <p>
            Using Xjournal's Glossary panel, you can easily insert text
            clippings into your posts. To open the Glossary, select the
            <i>Glossary</i> option from the <i>Window</i> menu. The
            Glossary is populated by text files located in the
            <code>Glossary</code> folder. To open this folder in the Finder,
            click the <b>Open Folder</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can add a new text clipping by saving a plain text file
            in the <code>Glossary</code> folder. For example, you could use
            TextEdit to create your clipping and save it. Then, click the
            <b>Refresh</b> button in Xjournal's Glossary panel. The new
            clipping will be listed by its filename. Select the clipping and
            then click the <b>Insert</b> button to paste the text in your post.
