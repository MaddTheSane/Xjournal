                Using the Bookmarks panel
            </h3>
        </font>
        <p>
            The Xjournal Bookmarks panel retrieves your bookmarks from Apple's
            Safari web browser as well as the Mac OS X Address Book. This panel
            allows you to easily drag and drop URLs into your journal entries.
            To do so, first open the Bookmarks panel by selecting the
            <i>Bookmarks</i> option from the <i>Window</i> menu. Then, drag the
            desired bookmark from the panel and drop it in your entry at the
            desired location for the URL.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>TIP:</b> You can also drag an item from the Bookmarks panel into
            the HREF field of the Insert Link sheet.
