                Linking to sites, friends, and communities
            </h3>
        </font>
        <p>
            To insert a link to a website, place your cursor at the point
            in your entry where you'd like the link to appear. Optionally, you
            may select the text you would like to have used in the <b>Linked
            Text</b> field. Next, select the <i>Insert Link</i> option from the
            <i>HTML</i> menu. Enter the desired <b>Linked Text</b> (the text
            that normally appears underlined in your post). Enter the URL of
            the site in the <b>Link URL</b> field and the title of the page in
            the <b>Title</b> field.  If desired, you can enter a target for the
            link to open in by using the <b>Target</b> field. Click the 
            <i>Insert</i> button and Xjournal will insert the necessary HTML
            into your entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            To link to a LiveJournal user or community, once again place your
            cursor at the point in your entry where you'd like the link to
            appear. Next, select the <i>Link to Journal</i> option from the
            <i>HTML</i> menu. Enter the name of the user or community you'd
            like to link and then click the <i>Insert</i> button to insert 
            the necessary code.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>TIP:</b> The text field used to link to a community or journal
            has a drop-down arrow that provides a list of your LJ friends and
            monitored communities.
