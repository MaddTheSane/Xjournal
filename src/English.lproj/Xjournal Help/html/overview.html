            Xjournal is a Mac OS X client for the LiveJournal.com weblog
            service. Xjournal has many features, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                With offline mode, you can create multiple journal entries
                without an Internet connection. Save them to disk to work on
                later and then post them to LiveJournal when you get back on
                the Internet!
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Xjournal reads your bookmarks from Safari and Address Book and 
                puts them on a palette for easy insertion into your journal 
                entries.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Using the History Browser, you can browse through all of your 
                LiveJournal entries. Display them right in Xjournal or use the 
                quick-link buttons to open them in your web browser for viewing
                or editing.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                The Friends tools allow you to easily edit your friends and 
                friend groups right in Xjournal. Use the notification
                preferences to keep you updated when your friends post, with
                a simple Dock indicator, a dialog box, or even one of your
                system sounds.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Xjournal's Glossary palette keeps snippets of text for quick
                drag and drop into your journal entries.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Using the Music preferences, you can have Xjournal auto-detect
                your currently playing song in iTunes and format it for posting
                with your journal entries.
            </li><br>
